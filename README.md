# ToDoApp
This is a simple todo app built using Tauri as an alternative to Electron and vanilla Typescript for the front end of the application.
I took on this project mainly to get better at using Typescript without a framework, and to learn some Rust along the way.

## Unqiue-ish features
- Export your tasks to a text file
- Saves tasks in between sessions as well as their completion status
- Feature to clear all current tasks or delete them individually
